Project Cato Installation File

INSTALLING CATO
---------------

As you'll see, I've tried to make installing Cato as easy as possible.
If you have a decent PHP environment already set up, the installation
should be a very simple process.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

Cato has been tested with:

  * The Apache web server
  * The MySQL database server
  * PHP version 5.3
  * Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6

It will probably work with other PHP 5.x systems. It will probably also
work with other web servers, databases, and it should work on Windows
and Linux systems. There is nothing Mac-specific about Cato, except the
default configuration files.

Cato requires:

  * The PHP MDB2 module
  * The Smarty templating system

With this release, these tools are now included with Cato to
make the installation process as easy as possible.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

With these two assumptions:

  1 You already have Apache, MySQL, and PHP installed.
  2 You already have the database for your project installed
    in your MySQL database.

you can install Cato very easily, as follows.

1) Set up a directory where you can install the Cato files.
   Cato is known to work with Apache, so the easiest way to
   install Cato is in an Apache 'htdocs' directory. On my Mac 
   I use MAMP, so Cato goes in this directory:
   
   /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/cato

2) While this step is optional, I've found it easier when 
   I have multiple web apps running on my computer.

   Create an entry in your "hosts" file for Cato. On my Mac
   I edit /etc/hosts, and add an entry for Cato like this:
   
   127.0.0.1   cato

   In the real world, my actual entry looks like this:
   
   127.0.0.1   localhost sleetmute drupal6 cato

3) Edit the Cato configuration files. The main file you
   need to configure is "db.cfg". This file tells Cato how to 
   connect to your database. On my system that file looks like
   this:
   
   $dsn = array(
     'phptype'  => 'mysql',
     'username' => 'root',
     'password' => 'root',
     'hostspec' => 'localhost',
     'database' => 'drupal6',
     'port' => '/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock'
    );

   If you're not using MAMP, you'll also have to edit the 
   "app.cfg" file. There are just a couple of settings in that
   file, and it should be well-documented.
   
   There is also a file named "smarty.cfg", which you'll only need
   to edit if you want to create some Smarty template variables.
   (This is really just for advanced users.)

4) Start/restart Apache. Again, I use MAMP, so I just restart
   Apache through the MAMP UI. Because MAMP runs Apache on
   port 8888 by default, I can now access the Cato UI through
   this URL:

   http://cato:8888/

At this point Cato should be up and running. If you haven't already
watched the video on how to use Cato, I recommend watching it now:

NO PHP?
-------

If you don't have PHP installed on your system, I'm afraid I won't 
be of too much help, but I'll give you what I can.

On Mac OS X systems, I *strongly* recommend using MAMP for PHP/MySQL 
development. You can download MAMP here:

  http://www.mamp.info

For Linux systems, I'll be really surprised if PHP isn't installed 
by default. If it isn't, you can probably using RPM or YUM to install 
it very easily.

For Windows, and for Linux systems without PHP installed, the best I 
can do is point you to the main PHP website:

  http://php.net

Just download the stable release from there.
