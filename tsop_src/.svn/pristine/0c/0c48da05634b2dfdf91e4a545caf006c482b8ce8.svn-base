Development To-Do List

* more and better templates
  * also create my own form style sheet api, or use the Rails or
    Cake CSS naming conventions
* better accounting for data types and database field names
  * textarea instead of text field (if i can detect varchar size, or related types)
  * drop-downs, checkboxes, and radio buttons where appropriate
  * date field widget based on type and/or field name
* handle the plural to singular conversions Cake and Rails handle
* clean up the root directory
